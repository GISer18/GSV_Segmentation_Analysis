**Summary** <br>
This folder contains built environment estimates derived from Google Street View (GSV) and remote sensing imagery.  Scripts used to derived this estimates are available on other github repositories listed in the external links section below. <br>

**Codebook** <br>
Variables are either built environment measures derived from images, built environment measures derived from remote sensing, or metadata about the GSV image and corresponding location.  Estimates of perceived scores from the Place Pulse dataset are available in the external link listed below.  <br>

**Image based built environment measures** <br>





**Repository Structure** <br>
Files are divided into two folders, based on their relative stage of project development. Scripts from a [previous project](https://github.com/larkinandy/LUR-NO2-Model) were utilized for downloading remote sensing imagery and generating buffer based estimates <br>

- **[BuiltEnvEstimates](https://github.com/larkinandy/LUR-NO2-Model/tree/master/variable%20estimates)** - Image and remote sensing estimates of the built environment (may not be available until publication). <br>
- **[StatisticalAnalysis](https://github.com/larkinandy/LUR-NO2-Model/tree/master/upwind%20estimates)** - Scripts to perform descriptive statistics and create regression models using built environment estimates.
